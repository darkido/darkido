- Hey, I'm darkido and it's my hobby account. 
- For now, I mainly work on ideas that come to my mind in my daily hobbies like watching anime, reading manga and this stuff.
- But my main purpose is to become an active open source contributor.
- It's all. If you are similar to me, we might have similar ideas to cooperate. So please contact me via [email](darkido256@gmail.com)
